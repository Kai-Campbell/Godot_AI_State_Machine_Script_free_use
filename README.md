# Godot_AI_State_Machine_Script_free_use
This AI state machine can be used for your Godot project! A free template to help make your AI come to life! Free for commercial or private use.

This script simply attaches to your AI characterbody3D and allows them to move! Once attached and placed into your scene, be sure to set the **object path**, if needed. You can set this to the player to allow a sort of zombie like character that wanders until the character is within distance, or you can attach it to a rigidbody3D, useful for sport games as well.
